TFG-ActiveLife\nVideo de como funciona\n\nEnlace al video\n\nDiario TFC\nMarzo 18, 2024\n\nComencé el proyecto y lo conecté al repositorio de Git para mantener todo organizado desde el principio.\n\nMarzo 20, 2024\n\nEstructuré el proyecto y configuré Firebase para la gestión de datos.\nImplementé el sistema de registro y login para que los usuarios puedan acceder fácilmente al sistema.\n\nMarzo 22, 2024\n\nDesarrollé el login y el registro, incluyendo la opción de autologin para una experiencia más cómoda.\nCreé los formularios de login/registro y los adapté según la acción del usuario.\n\nMarzo 24, 2024\n\nImplementé el sistema para aceptar nuevos usuarios y visualizar todos los registrados.\nAñadí la opción para registrarse como administrador o cliente, haciéndolo cómodo con un toggle.\n\nMarzo 25, 2024\n\nCreé el repositorio del Anteproyecto y organicé todo para la presentación (https://github.com/PabloGM1204/TFG-ActiveLife).\nElaboré el Anteproyecto en Notion y lo trasladé al repositorio, junto con un README.md para mantener a todos informados.\n\nMarzo 26, 2024\n\nFinalicé los ajustes en el repositorio del Anteproyecto para cumplir con los requisitos establecidos y lo envié a los profesores para esperar a su corrección.\n\nAbril 9, 2024\n\nInicié el diseño del proyecto en Figma, definiendo la apariencia del proyecto en Angular mientras el anteproyecto esta siendo corregido.\n\nAbril 12, 2024\n\nContinué trabajando en el diseño en Figma, aclarando ideas y tomando decisiones para avanzar.\n\nAbril 15, 2024\n\nViendo que los profesores no nos dicen nada sobre el Anteproyecto decidimos Antonio y yo empezar a desarrollarlo.\nRealicé ajustes para mejorar la gestión de usuarios.\n\nAbril 17, 2024\n\nImplementé una API de ejercicios (https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/) la cual es gratis hasta cierto punto pero los resultados nos lo devuelve en Ingles (Nuestro tutor David dijo que no había problema) pero aun los datos que nos devuelve son con imágenes y todo por lo que está muy bien.\n\nAbril 18, 2024\n\nHice que los usuarios creen sus propias rutinas y puedan buscar los ejercicios según sus preferencias de zonas (espalda, piernas, pecho, etc).\n\nAbril 20, 2024\n\nPermití que las rutinas al crearlas un admin pueda o no ser publicas para en el caso de serlas que el cliente y la landing page puedan verlas y añadí notificaciones visuales para mejorar la experiencia del usuario.\n\nAbril 23, 2024\n\nPersonalicé el swiper para adaptarlo a las necesidades del proyecto y lo integré en la página de inicio.\n\nAbril 24, 2024\n\nHabilité la edición de rutinas existentes y diferencié entre rutinas públicas y privadas para un mayor control.\nAñadí notificaciones visuales para informar a los usuarios sobre acciones relacionadas con las rutinas.\n\nAbril 25, 2024\n\nCorregí algunos problemas con el perfil de usuario y añadí la opción de subir una foto de perfil.\n\nAbril 29, 2024\n\nCreé el servicio de citas para gestionarlas y responderlas.\n\nMayo 1, 2024\n\nImplementé la capacidad para que los usuarios acepten, rechacen y vean detalles de las citas, y para que los administradores las gestionen fácilmente.\n\nMayo 2, 2024\n\nMejoré el diseño del swiper en la página de login y solucioné problemas con las citas.\n\nMayo 4, 2024\n\nRealicé algunos cambios visuales en la página de inicio para mejorar su apariencia.\n\nMayo 5, 2024\n\nAñadí estilo a la página de inicio y a los formularios de registro y login para hacerlos más atractivos.\n\nMayo 6, 2024\n\nMejoré el diseño del swiper en la página de login y del componente de login y registro.\n\nMayo 7, 2024\n\nSolucioné problemas con el autologin para facilitar el inicio de sesión ya que había un problema con el inicio de sesión anonimo.\n\nMayo 8, 2024\n\nPreparé la entrega del checkpoint con el diario, webgrafia, video.\nMejoré el css de la página de usuarios (Posibles cambios en el futuro).\n\nMayo 9, 2024\n\nAñado el modal para los distinto usuarios que se loguean y aun no tienen los permisos necesarios para entrar.\nMejoro el css de la Landing.\nCreo el video para despues actualizar el README.md con el mismo.\n\nWebgrafía\n\nSwiper documentation\nSwiper video\nToast\nApi de ejercicios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n
